# ASCII-bot
ASCII bot tracks attendance for club meetings by collecting student IDs. It allows users to mark themselves as present and maintains the data in a MySQL database to avoid repeatedly asking for user information and create a more efficient attendance process. 

---
## üí° Features
- Type 'start attendance' to begin tracking
- Users type 'here' to mark themselves as present
- If a user is not in the database, the bot will DM them and ask for their App State ID.
- Attendance is saved in a folder called 'Ascii_Attendance' on the desktop, with reports by date
- Attendance reports store App State IDs, the date, and total number of attendees.
